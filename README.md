Aims to make an automated low-level explainer for programs in Dennis Mitchell's esolang Jelly.

This is VERY MUCH a work in progress right now

## Setup

  1. Run setup.sh

  ```
  ./setup.sh
  ```

  2. Done setting up!

## Usage

There is not a proper interface yet, but you can use the program by running named_parsing.py with python3. Run the code `explain(test_string)`, where `test_string` is the program you want to explain.
